They are so incredibly small that you need a microscope to see them in detail. Within the vast world of living organisms, there are two primary cell types: plant and animal cells. While they share some similarities, they have distinct differences. For instance, plant cells have a rigid cell wall that provides support and structure, and they also contain chloroplasts, which they use for photosynthesis. In contrast, animal cells lack these features. Despite their differences, all cells contain a nucleus (the cell's control center), cytoplasm (a jelly-like fluid that fills the cell), and a cell membrane that acts like a protective gatekeeper, carefully controlling what enters and leaves the cell. Understanding these basic components and their functions is the first step toward understanding all of biology.",

        notes:
          "A force is a fundamental concept in physics‚Äîit is simply a push or a pull on an object. The relationship between force, mass, and motion is explained by Newton's Laws of Motion. The first law states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion, unless an outside force acts on it. The second law explains the quantitative relationship between force, mass, and acceleration, expressed by the famous equation F=ma (Force = mass √ó acceleration). The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. These laws help us understand how objects move and interact in our everyday world, from throwing a ball to riding in a car.",

        notes:
          "The rock cycle is a continuous, natural process that shows how Earth's rocks are constantly being created, changed, and destroyed. It's an excellent example of how our planet is never static. There are three main rock types that are transformed through this cycle. Igneous rocks form when molten rock, or magma, cools and hardens, either slowly underground or quickly on the surface after a volcanic eruption. Sedimentary rocks are created from compressed layers of tiny particles of other rocks, minerals, or organic matter over a long period. Metamorphic rocks form when existing rocks are subjected to intense heat and pressure deep within the Earth's crust, causing their form and composition to change. The rock cycle demonstrates that even the most solid parts of our planet are in a state of constant, slow-moving change.",
